# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a web application developed using React to receive information from The Guardian API about various articles and the latest news and displays it in a neat format. The website has a search feature where the user can search articles and look for specific words in the title.

Each component is broken down and are formed using the base level layouts in src/components/layouts. The web app makes use of the React Router to switch between rendering pages.

Media queries have been applied in each individual SCSS file to keep things neat and close to relevant code and have been developed so that the website is responsive and can run on any device.
